# Bayesian ClassiÔ¨Åer
We are building  Bayesian classifiers for the datasets the given dataset. .

Bayesian Classifiers: Builds Bayesian models using the given dataset for the given case numbers.

case number:          
                       1 -- Bayes with Covariance same for all classes

                       2 -- Bayes with Covariance different for all classes

                       3 -- Naive Bayes with C = \sigma^2*I.

                       4 -- Naive Bayes with C same for all classes.

                       5 -- Naive Bayes with C different for all classes.
